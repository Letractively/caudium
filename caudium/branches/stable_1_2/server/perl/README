mod_perl embedded Perl support for the Caudium webserver. Written by
Leif Stensson for the Roxen Webserver. First ported to Caudium by Jan
Legengausen. Additional porting by David Hedbor etc.

The server/perl/lib/ directory will contain Perl modules, and should
be added to @INC for Caudium-related Perl scripts.
