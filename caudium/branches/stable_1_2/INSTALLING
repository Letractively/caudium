Before Installing:

There are a few required packages for installing Caudium.  Most are included
with your distribution.  The configure script should alert you to anything
that is missing, but here is a list of packages that you will most likely
have to install yourself.

Required Packages:
  Pike 7.0 or 7.2:
    You will need version 7.0.268 or better.  Do not use the official
    7.0.78 available from pike.roxen.com, as it has bugs that affect
    Caudium's stability and performance.  Grab a CVS snapshot of Pike
    from http://caudium.net/download/snapshot.html until a newer
    version is officially released.
    However, we recommend pike 7.2 with Caudium 1.2 especialy because
    the next Caudium branch will require it...

Optional Packages (recommended)
  Sablotron (requires expat)
    In order to use the XSLT parser you will need to get the Sablotron
    XSLT parser package.  This is highly recommended.  As of version 0.50,
    you will need to install the expat libraries.  You can get these two
    packages from:

      Expat:
       http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/ 
      Sablotron:
        http://www.gingerall.com/

  MySQL or other SQL packages
    If you want to use an SQL database backend with Caudium, then you need
    to have it installed BEFORE building Pike.  You can get MySQL from
    http://www.mysql.com/

  PHP
    If you want to use Caudium's PHP4 support, you'll need to install it.
    You do not need to install before caudium, but you will need to restart
    the server if you install later.  You can use PHP3, but only through
    the CGI interface.

  NJS JavaScript Interpreter - HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL!!!
    If you want to use server side Javascript support, you'll need to install
    it. You need to install NJS library before compiling Caudium. See 
    http://www.bbassett.net/njs/ for more informations. You also need to
    enable the support explicitly by modifying the src/cmods/configure.in
    file. Also, note that you need the latest CVS version of NJS for this
    module to work.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing Caudium 1.2 from source:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  1. Get the source server package.

  2. Issue the command to unpack the archive:

          .tar.gz:
               If you have GNU tar; "tar xzf Caudium-archive-name"
               If you don't have GNU tar: 
               "gunzip < Caudium-archive-name| tar xf -" 
          .tar.Z
               If you have GNU tar; "tar xzf Caudium-archive-name"
               If you don't have GNU tar: 
               "uncompress < Caudium-archive-name| tar xf -"
          .tar
               "tar xf Caudium-archive-name"

     (where "Caudium-archive-name" is the name of the Caudium archive
     file.).

  3. Type "cd <caudium_version>" to change to the new directory. This
     directory should contain at the very least four directories:
     server (Caudium server source), src (extra pike modules), extern
     (misc. programs used by Caudium) and tools (misc tools). See README
     for more information about the directory structure.

     (Where caudium_version is the name of the unarchived Caudium directory.)

 4.  Type ./configure --prefix=<wanted_base_path_for_caudium>
     (prefix is optional and defaults to /usr/local, thus placing Caudium in
     /usr/local/caudium/) followed by make and make install to build
     the binaries and copy them to the correct place.

!!!  By default, the configuration will fail if the Sablotron XSLT
!!!  library isn't found. If you are not interested in XSLT
!!!  functionality, just add the flag '--without-PiXSL' to the
!!!  configure script.

     You can later on move the 'caudium' directory that will be
     created when you type 'make install' to anywhere in your
     filesystem. Caudium does not keep any absolute paths.
     
  5. If everything worked fine and the compilation is done, type 
     cd <dir>/server.

     (Where <dir> is <wanted_base_path_for_caudium>/caudium if you used 4.)

  6. Start the install script by typing ./install.

  7. Answer the simple questions and wait for your client.

  9. If everything worked, configure the server, otherwise move on to the
     troubleshooting section on the Caudium WWW-pages. 

 10. In order to start your server in the future (from startup scripts, etc)
     cd to <dir>/server and run ./start.

 Once you have installed the server, consider joining the Caudium
 mailing list by sending a mail to:

    caudium-general-request@caudium.net
