Changes in Caudium 1.0.XX
-------------------------
- The compilation process may skip rpath from the compiler/linker command line
  if either building a Debian package or the NO_RPATH_PLEASE variable is found
  in the environment when running configure (and smartlink thereafter).
- Corrected a bug in ftp protocol in pasv mode. Thanks to  Joe Radinger <cheese@nosuchhost.net>
- New configuration files are created with the 0600 permission bits now.
- Fix for bug #498377: the environment variable didn't show the complete url
  with the query.
- Added support for //!NOMODULE in modules. This close bug #473716
- oldcgi is not not shown in the module list.
- ldapuserauth.pike: fixed a security problem when using user access mode :
  it was possible to login as any user by typing any password when user 
  passwd was not in cache (eg where you were the first to login after a
  restart/start of caudium).
- ldapuserauth.pike: crypt problem fixed.
- little fixes with installation on OpenBSD

Changes in Caudium 1.0.36 (stable release 2, 2001-11-06)
--------------------------------------------------------
- Fix for bug #450757: When calling parse_rxml() when using the XML compliant
  RXML parser, make sure to propagate and keep custom tags correctly.
- Removed old network neighbourhood code.
- Fixed bug in connection timeout code. When running in non-threaded
  mode, long connections (ie large downloads) would be timed out
  incorrectly.
- Fixed a couple of problem related to ssl3.
- Fixed <if variable> to work with scopes.
- Throw a bad request answer if the file contains unencoded spaces
  (http2 protocol).
- Fixed bugs #432433 and #449140 (redirect module fixed)
- Fix to allow / in the name of modules and variables (bug #423435).
- Always simplify path in low_get_file. This is added to prevent the
  possibility of a bugs allowing access to files outside of the
  configured web page directories. Please note that there are no known
  such bugs in Caudium.
- Small bug fixed in UltraLog - when no extensions is specified,
  supply a default list and avoid a runtime error. Reported bu Michael
  Stenitzer.
- 123session backported from 1.1 source tree, with updated and modification
  submitted by Chris Davies
- LDAP Tag and LDAP Auth now support pike 7.x Protocols.LDAP and have
  a configurable version
- PiXSL now compiles on FreeBSD
- Supports updated with Opera 5.0 browser
- SQLuserdb backported from 1.1 with Chris Davies modifications

Changes in Caudium 1.0.34 (stable release 1, 2001-03-22)
--------------------------------------------------------
- Removed htmlparse dependency from the Enhanced Directory Listings
  module since we have two parsing modules now.
- Quote the chars < > @ in http_encode_url and http_encode_string.
- *** Removed CAMAS since it's not stable. Use the 1.1 version if you want
  *** to use it (either CVS or a snapshot).
- Correctly find libraries for various versions of Sablotron (0.50 and
  0.44 tested). 
- Fixed a bug in Caudium.ParseHTTP->create (http2.pike fix).
- Applied Chris Davies custom changes to the SQL User Database. These add a
  configurable timeout for cached user entries and an option to block sites
  with too many failed authentication attempts.
- Fixed some bugs in the XSLT Template module, added more configurable
  options. Also fixed the setting of the base uri.
- MSIE doesn't send the Pragma: no-cache header when you reload a
  page. This makes it really hard to reload certain things in Caudium,
  since that header is used to determine if the cache should or
  shouldn't be used. To solve this problem you can now use the
  prestate (nocache) to emulate this behavior. 
- Added new special token to the access log file name format. %H will
  be replaced with the hostname Caudium is running on. Useful if you
  use the same configuration file for multiple machines.
- New feature: access log files are now not opened until they are
  used. Also there is a configurable maximum idle time after which the
  log will be closed (can be disabled). Also made the "reopen timeout"
  somewhat random to avoid the "all log files reopen at the same time"
  misfeature.
- Print a nice error message when a suitable Pike isn't found during
  configuration.
- Fixed a bug in the UltraLog module when threads are unavailable.
- Corrected QUERY calls in the sql filesystem module.
- Backported improved data cache and http2 protocol from Caudium 1.1.
- Fixed various minor bugs and typos.
- Pike 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 are not supported with Caudium 1.0. The verify
  script now says this.
- Fixed security bug which allowed people to ge the RXML source code
  of a page if a request was made to an RXML file while Caudium was
  loading.
- Fixed error message when a modules was not found (accidently broken).
- Fixed <use> cache lookup (use the full path as the key, not the unresolved
  path).
- Added timeout for sending connections to work around problem in Pike where
  remotely closed connections aren't handled correctly. 
- Removed the bug-causing directory override feature. If you need to list
  directories, don't put an index.html in it.
- Fixed handling of precache modules in ip-less virtual servers. 

Changes in Caudium 1.0.10 (RC2, released 2000-12-14)
----------------------------------------------------
- Don't add '-lc' on SCO OpenServer and UnixWare when linking
  dynamic libraries (it's not needed and apparently potentially
  breaks things). Reported by Boyd Gerber.
- Remove smartlink from the cached CC value in the beginning of the configure
  script to account for times when the smartlink binary has been removed but
  config.cache is kept.
- Install script is now somewhat nicer. First of all it uses readline when
  available. Secondly it also asks for administrator name and password.
  Finally, it works with Pike 7.1 again.
- Various bugfixes to CAMAS, including support for Pike 7.1
- Removed NT compatibility hacks since we have no plans of ever
  supporting NT.
- Removed C++ comments from FastIMHO (fix compile error).
- Fixed the server template creator.
- Added a script that tries to find, and warn about, potential
  problem with the configured Pike. It is run at the end of the
  configure script.
- Fixed PHP4 scripting support when using the SSL3 protocol.
- FTP renaming should now work with the restricted filesystem with
  home dir remapping enabled [bug #124035].
- Some minor cosmetic changes with ports in the configuration interface.
- Use Mhash.Hash and PCRE.Regexp from Pexts (when available) in most
  situations where Crypto.md5/sha and Regexps are used.
- Fixed a 0.6 compatibility bug and noted that SSL will not work with
  Pike 0.6. This will not be fixed. If you need SSL, use Pike 7.0.  -
- Changed all '#if efun' to '#if constant'. This is a cosmetical
  change. However '#if efun' is deprecated.
- Fixed various (new) 7.1 compatibility issues. 
- Added the compact 'Add module' page originally added in Roxen 1.4.
- Fixed compile error reporting when loading the configuration interface.
- CAMAS support folders caching now.
- Made the ftp protocol use supplied error code if it's present after a
  command fails. This leads to more helpful error messages than
  "file not found'.
- CVS branched. The main trunk is now Caudium 1.1. To check work with the
  1.0 stable version, do a 'cvs update -r stable_1_0' in your checked
  out source tree.

Changes in Caudium 1.0.8 (RC1, released 2000-11-26)
---------------------------------------------------
- Caudium is a Roxen 1.3 fork. We have different goals and
  ideas on what the server need to become successful. We have opted to
  start on version 1.0 to point out that this is a different
  server. Check out our website at http://caudium.net/ for further
  information.
- We use SourceForge. This means public CVS, bug tracking, task lists
  and more. The URL is http://sourceforge.net/projects/caudium/ 
- Now works with Pike 7.0 and 7.1. To do this a number of minor fixes
  has been made. Functionality with 7.1 is not guaranteed since it's type
  control system is still improving. We recommend running Caudium with
  the latest 7.0 from CVS.
- Wrote query-string and HTTP header parsers in C. Seems to give a
  nice performance boast.
- Fixed small bug in htmlparse.pike when using tags that return a
  string directly.
- Added PiXSL, a glue to the XSLT parser Sablotron and UltraLog, a log
  parser, to the default distribution.
- Option to edit the server name removed and added option to hide
  server version.  Also added a header with the Pike version used to
  run Caudium. It can also be disabled (the version).
- Pike not isn't built as part of the server, but instead you specify
  which Pike you want to use (or use the default one).
- Don't send the Last-Modified header for dynamic (RXML-parsed)
  pages. Fixes caching problems with clients that correctly handles
  If-Modified-Since, like MSIE and Galeon.
- Changed files named roxen* to caudium*, as well as references to roxen->
  etc. Caudium should still be completely Roxen 1.3 compatible.
- Demo SSL-certificate fixed for Caudium.
- Various changes that might affect compatibility. Caudium should be
  100% compatible with Roxen 1.3 per default however. See
  README.compatibility for more details on this.
- protocols/http.pike use the parse_got David originally wrote for
  Roxen 2.1.  It sort-of-fixes the worst Roxen DOS (send an eternally
  long header and see Roxen use 100% CPU in no time). If you use http2.pike
  there is also a maximum request length which completely fixes the problem.
- new protocols/http2.pike: This is considered experimental but will
  eventually replace protocols/http.pike. Major differences from
  protocols/http.pike are: most request/header parsing done in C (even
  more so than http.pike), uses ram cache code from Roxen 2.1 +
  various rewrites for speed. This one, with the ram cache, is much
  faster than the other http protocol.
- new options to modules/filesystems/userfs.pike : banish list can
  be disabled if needed, the virtual user system has now the option
  to add a kind of "workaround" to add some prefix to user name on the
  URL, and when the option "Look at the user dir" is set to No, the 
  home filesystem can be hashed. Very good for home pages hosting.
- Fixed the bug that sometimes added \r\n to the POST data (often
  reported when Roxen was used with PHP, but it was in fact not related).
- Added support for and use the Roxen 2.x module registration syntax:
  module_type, module_name, module_doc and module_unique.
- Re-added (it disappeared in Roxen 1.3) an option to disable the extra
  Caudium environment variables in CGI-scripts since they sometimes cause
  unwanted problems.
- Replace the characters '-=$ ' with '_' in the Caudium specific
  environment variables to avoid potential problems when running CGI
  scripts.
- Added strftime argument to date-related tags (<modified>, <date>
  etc). Allows you to do custom formatting. See 'man strftime' on normal
  UNIX box for details on strftime.
- Added new option to <noparse>, 'until'. See <help for=noparse> for
  more information.
- Fixed a bug in the help tag.
- Cast the MySQL insert id result to a string in the <sqlquery>
  tag. Earlier it was inserted into id->variables as an integer, which
  caused various problems.
- New ip-less hosting module, Virtual Host Matcher, which does regular
  expression based matching. Default is to do exact-only matching. You
  can then write a regexp that "rewrites" a host header for this exact
  matching. Also allows for default matching by using .* as the regular
  expression match.
- New module type, MODULE_PRECACHE. Needed to combine virtual hosting
  and the http2 memory cache. Can also potentially be used to use custom keys
  for caching.
- Added define to disable the ip->host lookup in the config
  interface. See README.performance for details and the reasoning behind this.
- Split htmlparse.pike into two files. htmlparse.pike for the parser part and
  rxmltags.pike which contains all the tags.
- New "main" parser using the semi-XML-compliant Parser.HTML from Pike
  7.x.  This same HTML/XML parser is used by Roxen 2.x core as
  well. However we use it in a much more basic way, with less glue
  around it. I.e. Caudium's XML parser is not at all similar to that
  of Roxen 2.x in the Pike source level - we just use the same
  parser written in C.
- Added scope based variables using the 2.x syntax. Access though the
  entity syntax - &scope.var; - requires the new parser.
  <insert variable="scope.var" /> and similar syntaxes work with both parsers.
- Added <inc/> and <dec/> tags to increment/decrement the value of a
  variable.
- Added <dice/> tag from Roxen 2.1 - return a random number based on the
  "type" attribute.
- Moved to an inline documentation format. See doc/docspec.html for the
  specification. This will hopefully lead to more up-do-date docs and
  better documented code.
- Embedded PHP4 should be working pretty well now. Requires the very
  latest PHP4 source (from CVS, but when 4.0.4 is released, that'll
  work) and the latest Pike 7.0 or 7.1 source.
- Caudium now comes with CAMAS, which is a continuation / fork of
  IMHO.  The main reason being that newer IMHO most likely will only
  work with Roxen 2.x (even version 0.98 did not work with Roxen 1.3
  or Caudium), but there are other reasons too.
- External FastCGI program/library updated (might now work better than
  before).
- Tags are no longer priority based. Ie the priority of a tag module doesn't
  affect the order of tag parsing. This shouldn't break anything since I don't
  know of anyone using this feature. The reason for the change was to simplify
  the parse modules. Also the XML parser never supported this feature.
