Description: An extensible WWW server written in Pike
 Caudium is a modern, fast and extensible WWW server derived from Roxen. 
 Caudium is by default compatible with Roxen 1.3 although some incompatible 
 options, mostly introduced to improve the performance, security etc. of the
 server, can be turned on. 
 Caudium features built-in log parsing engine (UltraLog), XSLT parser, native
 PHP4 support (you need Pike7 that has been compiled to support php4 for this
 to work), multiple execution threads and many more features - see 
 http://caudium.net/ and http://caudium.org/ for more information.

Description: A webmail module for Caudium
 CAMAS (CAudium Mail Access System) is an IMAP-based, integrated webmail module
 for Caudium. It is built upon the Roxen IMHO package and thus backward compatible
 with it (as far as the config files are concerned). It contains many improvements,
 bug fixes, new features - better national language support, better layout manager,
 more configuration options, multi-domain mail support and more.

Package: caudium-dev
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, pike7 (= ${pikever})
Description: Developement files for Caudium
 This package is really a commodity one to facilate building the prospective PHP4
 package for Caudium. It contains only the files needed for the latter to detect 
 the presence of Caudium on the system.
