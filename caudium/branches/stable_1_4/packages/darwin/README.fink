The Caudium fink package has been done to be as MacOS X / fink friendly as
possible.

This package is still at alpha stage. There may still be some bugs or
weirdness. If so, don't hesitate to contact me <bertrand AT caudium DOT net>.



*******************************************************************************
** Caudium startup options
*******************************************************************************

By default, Caudium is configured:
  - to run threaded
  - to log in @prefix@/var/log/caudium1.4
  - to read configuration from @prefix@/etc/caudium1.4

These startup options can be changed in @prefix@/etc/defaults/caudium1.4



*******************************************************************************
** Starting/Stopping Caudium
*******************************************************************************

* Automatic startup:

By default, Caudium is started at boot using Fink's daemonic system. If you
don't want Caudium to start at boot, use the command:

sudo daemonic disable caudium1.4

Read the daemonic man page for more information.


* Manual startup/restart/stop:

If you want to manually start Caudium, use:

sudo @prefix@/bin/caudiumctl1.4 start

If you want to stop or restart Caudium, you can use:

sudo @prefix@/bin/caudiumctl1.4 stop
sudo @prefix@/bin/caudiumctl1.4 restart

The web-based interface can be used in order to restart and stop Caudium, too.

Don't launch yourself the start-caudium script from @prefix@/lib/caudium1.4/
otherwise, the config from @prefix@/etc/caudium1.4 wouldn't be read and it
could end up with unexpected results.



*******************************************************************************
** Caudium configuration
*******************************************************************************

Just after the installation, you are prompted for a login and a password in
order to log into the Web-based configuration interface.

Point your favorite web browser to http://127.0.0.1:22202/ and use the
self-explanatory interface to configure Caudium.
