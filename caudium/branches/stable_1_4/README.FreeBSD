A note for FreeBSD users
------------------------

Caudium 1.4 is not yet on FreeBSD ports, but
there is a port for Pike 7.6 located at /usr/ports/lang/pike76/

Note that also for obscur reason from IDA, that Pike 7.6 is not as stable
than 7.2 or 7.0.

So Caudium cannot be more stable on FreeBSD because of that facts. We are
sorry, you'll have to blame some folks at IDA.
