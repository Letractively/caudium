--------------------------------------------
- <if> no longer evaluates true if using the "element is value" syntax and the 
  element is not present.

- Fixed a backtrace when loading the WebApp module.
   (Bill Welliver)

Changes in Caudium 1.4.4 since Caudium 1.4.2
--------------------------------------------
- Backport of Watchdog stuff from the development branch:
  - Watchdog debug can be enabled using --watchdog-debug
  - If set using HTTP GET, the watchdog can now be set up either to check every
    1st level virtual server or either only the first one.
  - The watchdog can now check virtual servers using HTTP GET
   (Bertrand Lupart)
- The id->variables isn't set as before regarding variables with emtpy values,
  this broke the screen for adding a new virtual server.
	 (Bertrand Lupart)
- Watchdog PID check can now be disabled with --without-watchdog-pidcheck
  It is disabled by default on Linuxes < 2.6, since their threads
	implementations assigned different PIDs for each thread.
	 (Bertrand Lupart)
- Fixed backtrace when using <accessed since> or <accessed help> when accessed
  was handled by accessed-sql or accessed-memory.
	 (Bertrand Lupart)
- Not using strftime on solaris as it does not support the POSIX %z flag
  which rendered Caudium.cern_http_date() unusable.
   (Marek Habersack)
- The id->variables wasn't set as before regarding empty values, this broke
  some applications and most notably lead to internal server error when
  reseting a variable in the configuration interface.
   (David Gourdelier)
- Comparing of empty strings didn't work in RXML so this lead to wrong 
  <if match...>
   (David Gourdelier)
- Fix for the RXML parsers sending the wrong content-type header when parsing
  a non-html document.
   (James Tyson)
- Error code was incorrectly set to 401 for every error.
   (David Gourdelier)

  on the hosted machine.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Fixed loading of Crypto related Configuration Actions in CIF.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Fixed a segfault in Caudium C module when broken variable assignments
  in the query part of the url are parsed (eg ?foo=too&hop=&gazon=zz - hop= 
  is the invalid syntax), SF bug #1028622
   (Marek Habersack)

Changes in Caudium 1.4.1 since Caudium 1.3.31
---------------------------------------------
- Fixed a prehistoric bug where Caudium couldn't write to log file because 
  it was creating a directory instead of a file. 
   (David Gourdelier)

   (Marek Habersack)
- HTTP/1.1 absolute URIs are correctly ignored now. SF Bug # 613187
   (Marek Habersack)
- Changed rxmltags.pike to automatically parse !DOCTYPE and ?xml and set
  id->misc->is_xml.  Changed several tag modules to use xml compliant
  Caudium.make_tag where appropriate.  SF Bug # 1015082.
   (James Tyson)
- Changed Storage.Methods.Disk to explicitly destruct unused Stdio.File
  objects in the hope of fixing SF bug #  979401.
   (James Tyson)
- Modified Servlet module so that Jasper can run on its own. 
   (Bill Welliver)
- Web Applications work again, including Jasper JSP 
   (Bill Welliver)
- Added Caudium.Crypto_Randomnesis API. This should help developpers
  that still use Crypto.randomness to get random data to be still 
  compatible without changing too mutch their code.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Added low level function : _Caudium.program_object_memory_usage() from
  Grubba (with some little modifications) to get real memory usage.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Fully implement Cache disk indexing.  This _really_ speeds up load times.
  but please remove your cache directory.
   (James Tyson)
- Add support for creating Storage.pmod tables on Postgres too.
   (Jeff Utter, James Tyson)
- Remove all thread locking from Cache.pmod/* and Storage.pmod/* since pike's
  threads don't really work anyway, and there is really very little chance of
  contention.
   (James Tyson)
- In Gsession, you can give any number of arguments to the function to call
  when the session expires using set_expire_hook().
   (David Gourdelier)
- Now Caudium display the compilation error when loading or reloading a
  module like it did on 1.2 branch.

  Fixed some wrong return type for images from the CIF in the HTTP headers.
   (David Gourdelier)
- Fixed some breakage on bump_version / snapshots etc... since we have 
  moved the version of caudium from base_server/caudium.pike into 
  etc/modules/CaudiumVersion.pmod
   (Xavier Beaudouin)

Changes in Caudium 1.3.23 since Caudium 1.3.21
----------------------------------------------
- Fixed rxmltags.pike:tag_use() that prevented using <use file=""> RXML tag at
  all when using VHS because it completly emptied id->misc.
   (Bertrand Lupart)
- Fix HTML 4.01 strict compliance in gsession.
   (Jeff Utter, David Gourdelier)
- Added make_html_tag, make_html_container, make_html_tag_attributes that 
  output HTML compliant strings escaping any unsafe characters (only " 
  actually).
   (David Gourdelier)
- Added make_xml_tag, make_xml_container, make_xml_tag_attributes that
  output XML compliant strings escaping any unsafe characters.
   (David Gourdelier)
- Modifed make_tag, make_container, make_tag_attributes so that you can
  output either HTML or XML strings with the value of the last argument of 
  these functions.
  You can give id->misc->is_xml as the last argument of these functions and
  it'll automatically output the correct string format according to the
  headers of your RXML template.
  Default to HTML output (exactly the same output as Caudium 1.2).
   (David Gourdelier)
- Added Caudium.xml_encode_mapping and Caudium.html_encode_mapping that
  respectivly encode the key/value pairs of a mapping into a XML or HTML safe
  key/value pairs. This should be much faster than doing the same in Pike.
   (David Gourdelier)
- Added an option to _make_tag_attributes so that you can specify the 
  encoding to use, can be HTML or XML (default to HTML).
   (David Gourdelier)
- Fixed a bug that prevent the quoting of " in _make_tag_attributes as well
  as some missing encoding for XML.
   (David Gourdelier)
- The site_id variable has been added in the Caudium request id object for
  making modules 2nd level virtual hosting (2lvh) safe.
  Basically, this has to be used instead of id->conf->name has a key for
  caching data for the module to be 2lvh-safe.
  By default, it is set to id->conf->name. If 2lvh is wanted, the 2lvh module
  should override it by its data in precache_rewrite().
  Code fixed:
	- accessed-old.pike
	- caucho.pike
	- configuration.pike (try_get_file())
	- htaccess.pike
	- rimage.pike
	- rxmltags.pike (<insert>, <use>)
  Code enhanced:
	- vhs_system_ldap.pike
	- vhs_system_sql.pike
   (Bertrand Lupart)
- Fixed a bug preventing caching of ActiveDirectory authentication
  information. Authentication using ActiveDirectory should be much faster.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Fixed a bug where PATH_INFO environnement variable wasn't give to scripts 
  executed throught uniscript modules.
   (David Gourdelier)
- Fixed a bug in store() and added debug mode in Gsession.
   (David Gourdelier)
- Allow for having tags & containers which are not in a Caudium module but for
  example in Pike module using the XML parser.
   (David Gourdelier)
- Added mimetype for XSL stylesheets.
   (James Tyson)
- Removed proxy.pike, use simple_proxy instead.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Removed relay.pike, it is too buggy because of spinner's day shuffler()
  function.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Removed ftp / proxy server templates.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Fixed a bug that appear between 1.3 and 1.2 preventing the SSL from
  working with HTTP answers that don't send data like 302.
   (David Gourdelier)
- Added a -DHTML_DEBUG to debug every tags/containers/whatever call in the
  XML compliant RXML parser and doing a gauge() on each of your function to
  allow easier RXML code optimization. 
   (David Gourdelier)
- The functions in _Caudium.so now use the new scratchpad volatile buffer 
  code instead of alloca.
   (Marek Habersack)
- Now Caudium.make_tag_attributes() uses the _Caudium._make_tag_attributes()
  C routine. Start Caudium with -DUSE_OLD_MAKE_TAG_ATTRIBUTES if you have
  problems using the new code. This "workaround" will be removed in the 1.4 
  release.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Remove the proxy disk cache since it's not useful, buggy and contains lot of
  junk.
   (David Gourdelier)
- Caudium.httpdate_to_time() now uses _Caudium.parse_date(). Faster than
  using Calendar.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- The function in _Caudium modules handled by datetime.c was not correctly
  exported into main _Caudium module this is now fixed (except for get_date).
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Navigation bar that behaves better when managing a lot of elements
   (Guillaume Fraysse)

   (David Gourdelier)
- Adding chroot support to CGI (and then FastCgi, Uniscript...).
   (Xavier Beaudouin)

  on FreeBSD 4.x when called from _Caudium.http_encode_url(). SF Bug #902691.
   (Xavier Beaudouin) 
- Added Caudium.Crypto.urandom() function to wrap easily the correct random
  source according to the Pike version.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Fix bug in Cache.FastStorage which caused devide by zero when calculating
  object hitrates.
   (James Tyson)
- Add tests around System.getrusage() so that Caudium can fall back to
  predef::rusage if necessary.
   (James Tyson)
- Backout changes in Storage.Method.Disk because it was completely broken.
   (James Tyson)
- Added the XML-RPC server. Contributed by David Gourdelier, Martin Baehr and
  Karl Pitrich. 
    (David Gourdelier)
- In the SSI Compat Tags module don't cache include virtual if the included
  url is a dynamic one.
   (Tamas Tevesz [from endre at interware dot hu]).

   (James Tyson)
- Removed unnecessary inline statements from a few functions.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Caudium now requires Pike 7.5
   (Marek Habersack)

  Tomcat instances.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Ideas and fixes for Pike script support mark II to help compatibility 
  applied.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Created new version of uniscript that uses FastCGI to communicate with 
  the script interpreter, hopefully providing better performance.

  ask for a mountpoint that ends with and '/' at the end to avoid potential
  security problems (eg list of files directories) (SF bug #713835).
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Fixes in responses given to FTP client in the ftp protocol. Mostly because
  Opera don't like it too much. (SF bug #560771)
   (Xavier Beaudouin)

  version and include under a FreeBSD port.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Fix a bug in ssl3.pike where the redirect from http would always pick the
  admin port.
- Caudium.make_tag_attributes() now write args whose name value equals name

  Tomcat and Jetty servlet engines.
- <if group="somegroup"> now consults the new naming system for group 
  membership information, as well as the groupfile option.
- LDAP and SQL authentication sources have been completely rewritten, 
  with incompatible settings. Users of these authentication sources will 
  need to check their settings when these modules are upgraded.
- Authentication and naming system has been completely rewritten. The 
  system consists of a Master handler and one or more stackable 
  authentication source providers. The new system also provides built in 
  access to groups and group membership information. The new 
  authentication system  provides new APIs, the existing APIs have been  
  deprecated. Virtual servers that utilize existing authentication modules 
  will be upgraded to the new system automatically on the first startup.
- An automatic upgrade system is in place, for updating settings that may 
  have incompatably changed between releases. A global variable "Upgrade 
  Performed?" allows the upgrade procedure to be run manually on the next 
  restart. Output messages are sent to the debug log and the CIF Event log.
- Changed Cache API slightly to make programming easier.
- Added some wrappers to parse_html() and parse_html_lines() that are
  called Caudium.parse_html() and Caudium.parse_html_lines(). This wrapper
  is Wide Strings complian (eg >8 bits compatible) and is set per default.
  If you have bugs with it, please send it to bugs@caudium.info. You can
  use the old parser from spider module (Pike) by starting Caudium with
  OLD_SPIDER define set.
- Headline module has been removed. This was mostly a hack from Headline
  module from David Hedbor (see roxen community for that) and it is too
  buggy and not really clean.
- Caudium.so pike glue in now _Caudium. A Pike module library is here to handle
  all functions that are coded in C or in Pike or that uses both things.
- Fix a bug with icons and virtual directories like /mail/ in gbutton module.

Changes in Caudium 1.3 since Caudium 1.2.1
------------------------------------------

- Fixed a bug in the new compression module : when using things like <insert>

  Should be provided as a series of filenames sparated by commas. The cacert
  should be first and the server cert should the be last.
- Old auth modules are now in server/deprecated_modules.
- IP Less module is now in server/deprecated_modules. Don't forget to add this
  to you module list if you still need it.
- Fix an error in disk_cache.pike on hash() call since it has changed a lot
  since pike 7.0.
- mod_perl / Perl support for Caudium is known to work now... but only with
  perl 5.8. This close sf bug #512601.
- Added a README.Perl
- Fix for SF Bug #652095 (lowercase boundary in CONTENT_TYPE)

- Added minor change to mainconfig.pike to allow Caudium version number to
  appear in the title
- Updated SQLuserdb to utilize new accept group= code
- added new module ACL: accept group=
  This addition augments id->auth with a fourth array member which is the
  user's group.
- defined, then promptly obsoleted and introduced a new api for MODULE_TYPES

  any warning to the user. Now it displays in red on the HTML output.

  properly.

  both normal variable of the &form; scope and those of the &var; scrope.
