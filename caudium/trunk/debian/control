Description: An extensible WWW server written in Pike
 Caudium is a modern, fast and extensible WWW server derived from Roxen. 
 Caudium is by default compatible with Roxen 1.3 although some incompatible 
 options, mostly introduced to improve the performance, security etc. of the
 server, can be turned on. 
 Caudium features built-in log parsing engine (UltraLog), XSLT parser, native
 PHP4 support (you need Pike7 that has been compiled to support php4 for this
 to work), multiple execution threads and many more features - see 
 http://caudium.net/ and http://caudium.org/ for more information.
