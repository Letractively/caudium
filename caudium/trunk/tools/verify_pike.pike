/*
 * This is a small utility to verify and find potential problems with
 * the pike version the user wants to run with Caudium. It's run automatically
 * at the end of the configure script.
 *
 * Things to know:
 *
 *  - this script has to run with any pike (back to 0.6, i can try 0.5
 *    if anyone can give me one...)
 *  - a specific Caudium version number can be passed as an argument; then it
 *    will do the checks appropriate for that version only. if no version
 *    number is supplied, it will do all the checks (as it was doing before
 *    this change).
 *    NOTE: the version number format has to be "%d.%d"!
 *
