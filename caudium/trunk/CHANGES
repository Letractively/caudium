Changes in Caudium 1.5.1 since Caudium 1.4.1
---------------------------------------------
- Starting Caudium with --gdb now turns the watchdog off.
   (Bertrand LUPART)
- Some work on accessed-sql:
  - now 2nd level virtual hosting safe
	- fix for a first loading bug that required to restart Caudium
	- now possible to use <counter add="0"> for not incrementing the counter
	 (Bertrand LUPART)
- _Caudium.getip() call to get interfaces names and ips for *BSD flavors.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- <if> no longer evaluates true if using the "element is value" syntax and the
  element is not present.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Fixed a backtrace during load of the WebApp module.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Watchdog debug can be enabled using --watchdog-debug
   (Bertrand Lupart)
- If set using HTTP GET, the watchdog can now be set up either to check every
  1st level virtual server or either only the first one.
   (Bertrand Lupart)
- The watchdog can now check virtual servers using HTTP GET
   (Bertrand Lupart)
- The id->variables isn't set as before regarding variables with emtpy values,
  this broke the screen for adding a new virtual server.
   (Bertrand Lupart)
- Watchdog PID check can now be disabled with --without-watchdog-pidcheck
  It is disabled by default on Linuxes < 2.6, since their threads
  implementations assigned different PIDs for each thread.
   (Bertrand Lupart)
- Fixed backtrace when using <accessed since> or <accessed help> when accessed
  was handled by accessed-sql or accessed-memory.
   (Bertrand Lupart)
- Not using strftime on solaris as it does not support the POSIX %z flag
  which rendered Caudium.cern_http_date() unusable.
   (Marek Habersack)
- The id->variables wasn't set as before regarding empty values, this broke
  some applications and most notably lead to internal server error when
  reseting a variable in the configuration interface.
   (David Gourdelier)
- Comparing of empty strings didn't work in RXML so this lead to wrong
  <if match...>
   (David Gourdelier)
- Fix for the RXML parsers sending the wrong content-type header when parsing
  a non-html document.
   (James Tyson)
- Pikegraphy now likes filenames with spaces.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Watchdog should now work with servers that change uid.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Stopping/restarting of server should work properly now, especially for servers that change uid.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Fix a backtrace in Config-Action openports when there is no lsof located 
  on the hosted machine.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Fixed loading of Crypto related Configuration Actions in CIF.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Fixed a segfault in Caudium C module when broken variable assignments
  in the query part of the url are parsed (eg ?foo=too&hop=&gazon=zz - hop= 
  is the invalid syntax), SF bug #1028622
   (Marek Habersack)
