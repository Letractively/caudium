Changes in Caudium 1.1 since CVS branching
-----------------------------------------------
- Added embedded Perl script / perl tag support from Roxen, originally
  ported to Caudium by Jan Legenhausen.
- Made the ftp protocol use supplied error code if it's present after a
  command fails. This leads to more helpful error messages than
  "file not found'.
- filesystem.pike improvements:
  - Removed the stat cache completely. It's not any major benefit
    unless you have a dog slow system / disk with lots of requests and
    even then it has questionable benefits. The gain of using it is
    also very small.
  - Organized options in sub-levels for easier overview.
  - Added default settings for umask as well as new file and directory
    modes.
  - Added an option to keep the permissions on files replacing by an
    upload.
  - Made the access method configuration finer grained. Now you can
    disable individual features like chmod and mkdir.
    COMPATIBILITY ALERT: Before the PUT method permission was used for
    the new features. This is no longer true and therefor server which
    allows PUT needs to enable the CHMOD, MKDIR and MV after
    upgrading!
- Removed htmlparse dependency from the Enhanced Directory Listings
  module since we have two parsing modules now.
- Quote the chars < > @ in http_encode_url and http_encode_string.
- added the excellent gbutton.pike module from Roxen 2.x
- Added processing instructions in the XML parser. This is tags using the
  syntax <?tagname contents ?>. Current existing processing instructions are
  <?pike ?> (Pike tag module), <?comment ?> (rxmltags), <?perl ?>
  (perl module).
- Wrote a tar filesystem module. This module allows you to mount an
  uncompressed tar file in the virtual filesystem.
- Added new http_error handler. The old 404 handler is still there, but
  disabled per default. This has now been modified to it's almost final
  state. Just waiting on InternalFiles to be finished.
- Correctly find libraries for various versions of Sablotron (0.50 and
  0.44 tested).
- Fixed some bugs in the Caudium c-module.
- Fixed newer 7.1 compaztibility problems (bye bye Simulate).
- Applied Chris Davies custom changes to the SQL User Database. These add a
  configurable timeout for cached user entries and an option to block sites
  with too many failed authentication attempts.
- Fixed some bugs in the XSLT Template module, added more configurable
  options. Also fixed the setting of the base uri.
- Some major optimizations related to http2 and cached responses. Also
  removed support for 'config in url' in the http2 protocol completely (ie
  /<...config...>/foo.bar).
- MSIE doesn't send the Pragma: no-cache header when you reload a
  page. This makes it really hard to reload certain things in Caudium,
  since that header is used to determine if the cache should or
  shouldn't be used. To solve this problem you can now use the
  prestate (nocache) to emulate this behavior. 
- Added new special token to the access log file name format. %H will
  be replaced with the hostname Caudium is running on. Useful if you
  use the same configuration file for multiple machines.
- New feature: access log files are now not opened until they are
  used. Also there is a configurable maximum idle time after which the
  log will be closed (can be disabled). Also made the "reopen timeout"
  somewhat random to avoid the "all log files reopen at the same time"
  misfeature.
- Fixed security bug which allowed people to ge the RXML source code
  of a page if a request was made to an RXML file while Caudium was
  loading.
- Fixed error message when a modules was not found (accidently broken).
- Wrote a new non-blocking data sender that is somewhat more efficient
  and much less buggy than Pipe.pipe. Also uses a moving window when
  mmapping large files, thus overcoming the major problem with
  Pipe.pipe for high traffic, large file sites.
- Fixed <use> cache lookup (use the full path as the key, not the unresolved
  path).
- Removed the bug-causing directory override feature. If you need to list
  directories, don't put an index.html in it.
- Fixed handling of precache modules in ip-less virtual servers.
- Added timeout logic to http protocols (from Caudium 1.0).
- Removed network neighbourhood code.
- Use Caudium.nbio to send POST data to CGI scripts. It makes for
  example uploads of large files (<input type=file>) __MUCH__
  faster (data transfer of a 25 MB file went from about a minute to a
  few seconds - pure Caudium CPU usage savings).
