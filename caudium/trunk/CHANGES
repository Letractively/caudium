Changes in Caudium 1.3 since Caudium 1.2.1
------------------------------------------
- Minor changes to Tablify.pike/Wizard.pike to generate HTML that is
  able to be validated
- Fix htaccess module for redirecttemp, redirecttemporary, redirectperm,
  redirectpermanent, authuserfile, authname, authgroupfile, redirect and
  errorfile.
- New module the format nicely the pike source code into HTML.
- Set "Lazy entity end" default to yes (XML-compliant RXML parser)
- Added ::login:: regexp (unixlike allowed regex for login / user) to
  superform
- Fixed bug in the Explicit Hostname Redirector module if used in a SSL
  virtual server, and if redirection is needed, the module was doing its
  rediretion to a non SSL server. (sf bug #602846)
- Added minor change to mainconfig.pike to allow Caudium version number to
  appear in the title
- Updated SQLuserdb to utilize new accept group= code
- added new module ACL: accept group=
  This addition augments id->auth with a fourth array member which is the
  user's group.
- defined, then promptly obsoleted and introduced a new api for MODULE_TYPES
  (see server/modules/misc/contenttypes.pike for short docs), modified
  server/base_server/configuration.pike:type_from_filename() so that it now
  conforms to this new api.
- redid the contenttypes parser. split etc/extensions in two separate
  files (for extensions and encodings), as it is logical.
- Added the handling of external mime-types definitions to contenttypes.pike
- Added a nifty new 3rdparty module that implements menus using prestates.
- Re-enabled permanent storage of the "program" datatype when using pike7.3
  build >= 51. Pike bug #3096 resolved.
- Added a quick and dirty mass virtual hosting module to the third-party
  repository.
- Fixed modules/tags/developer.pike.
- Fixed a compilation error in modules/tags/hash.pike. Now we actually do
  have the SHA1 hashing method, with three aliases even.
- Fixed bug in http.pike/mainconfig.pike that didn't allow modules with a :
  in the name to be selected in the Configuration Interface
- Removed legacy Argument Cache code and folded it into the Cache Manager.
- Fixed bug in the XML compliant RXML parser that caused to to backtrace on
  certain tags (like <H1 />).
- Added support for the default character set for the returned content
  type. The information is sent in the Content-Type response header and
  may be overwritten using the <meta> tag in the document.
- Added support in VHS LDAP to use Caudium system log directory instead of
  userdir one.
- Added .htaccess manual link... Useful since most of Apache users think
  that our .htaccess is compatible..
- Autoconf 2.53+ is now required to build Caudium from CVS
- Added string hash module.
- Added support in VHS Sql to use Caudium system log directory instead of      
  userdir one.
- index.php and index.php3 now added in all directories modules.
- Added support for RFC 3236 (XHTML media type)
- Fix an error when PUT method is used...
- Variable HTTPS is set to "on" when SSL is used. (compatibility variable 
  used for CGIs...)
- Webdav protocol implementation (RFC 2518) added. Not finished yet
- Added a -DMAX_BODY_SIZE=<size> option for starting caudium. The default size
  for the body is 16k otherwise. 
- Updated the error message that occured when the user want to list the open 
  ports in the CIF and Caudium does not run as root.
- svg/svgz file image format handling.
- Fix a problem when Caudium is not running as root : display a warning if 
  the user tries to run lsof in open ports action tab.
- The Generate a self signed certificate and a RSA key-pair was not delivering
  any warning to the user. Now it displays in red on the HTML output.
- Added a link to the caudium.info website from the CIF.
- 404 handler is not set per default on Old 404 system. To avoid 1.0 -> 1.2    
  compatiblity and keep the XML-Compliant parser quiet. 
- Fixed #530674: passive mode FTP connection problem (with Mozilla  
  and derivative browsers).
- <if exists="file"> shouldn't use the cache. Thanks to Hirling Endre.
- The start script now changes the cwd to the directory it is started from.
  Prevents beginners from crying.
- Fixed bug #547354 - <aconf> URIs don't work
- Fixed bug #542177 that makes incorrect listings from directories2.pike.
- Fixed bug #514391 (user listing in userfs), seems that Caudium Cache.
- Fixed bug #533861 <wizard> was broken. Autodocs now added, new features like
  formname attribute to wizard conatiner, hidden "verify" container.
- SSL.pmod used is the one from Pike now. This verification is now done
  when configure script is ran.
- Caudium 1.3 now *REQUIRES* pike 7.2+ or more recent (7.2.xxx with xxx > 200).
- Fixed the Last-Modified code in http.pike and http2.pike. If the request is
  not marked as dynamic (!id->misc->is_dynamic), then the header will be sent 
  properly. 
- It is now possible to unset more than one variable at a time by using globs,
  both normal variable of the &form; scope and those of the &var; scrope. 
  Undefine of defines, tags and containers also works with globs. Patch #536492
  from disumu.
- Added patch #534125 to ultralog that check the file exist before set 
  filewatch and a status of the module.
- Added patch #534118 that fix for TYPE_FILE and TYPE_DIR checks.
- Half fixed bug #533124. There is no backtrace but I'm not really pleased 
  by the way how it is fixed...
- Fixed bug #530674
- Added support for Darwin (MacOS X) dynamic loading and correct pic flag for it.
- business graphics module now creates the cache directory in the correct
  location (under the argument_cache_dir hierarchy)
- Now font name can be specified in <diagram > tag and use the CIF default
  font name.
- Scopes compatibility is to On/Conditional. If there is problems about that
  (cf bugs #514651 & #512647) then change it to Off/Conditional. 
  Changes is due because there will more issues from users moving from
  Caudium 1.0 to 1.2 than Roxen 1.3 to Caudium 1.3...

  http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html), error pages was able to
  send abitrary code to browser using non existant pages (like for example :
  http://www.foo.server/<script>alert("CSS");</script>).
- Fixed bugs #514651 & #512647 : Scopes compatibility break RXML
- Fixed bug #514653 : Unitialized variables get backtraces when try to
  expr them (same code : <formoutput><set variable=GT expr="#GT# + #Z#">
  </formoutput> was give backtrace if either GT or Z was not previously
  initialized).
- File index.rxml is now recognized as index file.
- New cache system added
