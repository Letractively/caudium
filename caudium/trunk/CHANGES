Changes in Caudium 1.3 since Caudium 1.3.14
-------------------------------------------
- Fix a bug in autoconf script that stop the correct detection of pike
  version and include under a FreeBSD port.
- Fix a bug in ssl3.pike where the redirect from http would always pick the
  admin port.
- Caudium.make_tag_attributes() now write args whose name value equals name
  as foo="foo" instead of just foo.
  This might be some legacy stuff that isn't XML compliant. 
  This applies to Caudium.make_tag() and Caudium.make_container().
- Now pike highlighter supports CSS :)
- Added sscanf container for RXML.
- Open Ports Wizard is now fixed and give more accurate informations.
- Old FCGI-CGI backend is now disabled per default. If you'd like to use the
  old FastCGI interface, please provide --with-oldfastcgi to ./configure 
  script.
- Added AJP | Tomcat Connector module to allow connecting to Jakarta 
  Tomcat and Jetty servlet engines.
- <if group="somegroup"> now consults the new naming system for group 
  membership information, as well as the groupfile option.
- LDAP and SQL authentication sources have been completely rewritten, 
  with incompatible settings. Users of these authentication sources will 
  need to check their settings when these modules are upgraded.
- Authentication and naming system has been completely rewritten. The 
  system consists of a Master handler and one or more stackable 
  authentication source providers. The new system also provides built in 
  access to groups and group membership information. The new 
  authentication system  provides new APIs, the existing APIs have been  
  deprecated. Virtual servers that utilize existing authentication modules 
  will be upgraded to the new system automatically on the first startup.
- An automatic upgrade system is in place, for updating settings that may 
  have incompatably changed between releases. A global variable "Upgrade 
  Performed?" allows the upgrade procedure to be run manually on the next 
  restart. Output messages are sent to the debug log and the CIF Event log.
- Changed Cache API slightly to make programming easier.
- Added some wrappers to parse_html() and parse_html_lines() that are
  called Caudium.parse_html() and Caudium.parse_html_lines(). This wrapper
  is Wide Strings complian (eg >8 bits compatible) and is set per default.
  If you have bugs with it, please send it to bugs@caudium.info. You can
  use the old parser from spider module (Pike) by starting Caudium with
  OLD_SPIDER define set.
- Headline module has been removed. This was mostly a hack from Headline
  module from David Hedbor (see roxen community for that) and it is too
  buggy and not really clean.
- Caudium.so pike glue in now _Caudium. A Pike module library is here to handle
  all functions that are coded in C or in Pike or that uses both things.
- Fix a bug with icons and virtual directories like /mail/ in gbutton module.

Changes in Caudium 1.3 since Caudium 1.2.1
------------------------------------------

- Fixed a bug in the new compression module : when using things like <insert>
  in RXML pages the data was compressed twice.
- <accessed> tag is now handled in a separate module. To have old behavior,
  use "Accessed Tag Counter: Old version", other supports Memory, SQL, FileDB
  are also available.
- mod_caucho support for Resin updated to support multiple instances of resin
  and load balancing among them. Also added support for RXML parsing of output.
- Java Servlet module updated to Servlet API 2.2, handles file extensions 
  and allows output to be RXML parsed.
- Added in etc/include/performance.h a define that allow administrator
  to force load all configurations and modules at the starting of Caudium.
  Note this is not recommanded if you have thousands of virtuals servers.
  You can use this with ./start script on a runtime : -DLOAD_CONFIGS_STARTUP
- Apache/NSCA SSI tags are now handled into a separate module called
  SSI Compat Tags (ssi_compat.pike). Don't forget to add this to your
  configuration interface if you need this support...
- Fix pluging path for rimage module.
- modules/scripting/oldcgi.pike and modules/scripting/fcgi.pike are now 
  deprecated. For FastCGI support you can use now fastcgi.pike that work
  mutch better than the old one.
- Fix submitted in caudium_general ml about corrupted Accessed db.
- Fix for sf bug #634688: Backtrace with cache and start as user.
- Fixed error in setools.pike regarding user agent & regexp
- We can now accept a certification chain instead of just a single certificate.
  Should be provided as a series of filenames sparated by commas. The cacert
  should be first and the server cert should the be last.
- Old auth modules are now in server/deprecated_modules.
- IP Less module is now in server/deprecated_modules. Don't forget to add this
  to you module list if you still need it.
- Fix an error in disk_cache.pike on hash() call since it has changed a lot
  since pike 7.0.
- mod_perl / Perl support for Caudium is known to work now... but only with
  perl 5.8. This close sf bug #512601.
- Added a README.Perl

  API_COMPAT is set.
- Caudium.http_encode_string() used instead of Pike's base_server/http.pike one.
  *COMPAT Warning* Direct calls to http_encode_string() work only when
  API_COMPAT is set.

- Caudium now _requires_ Pike 7.4.1+
- Caudium can now be monitored using SNMP
- Set the "charset" field in the response mapping to specify the
  charset for the file being served. Otherwise a default charset
  is used (if enabled in the CIF).

  content and has a set of new features:
  . include/exclude rules
  . statistics
  . max/min data size

- Added minor change to mainconfig.pike to allow Caudium version number to
  appear in the title
- Updated SQLuserdb to utilize new accept group= code
- added new module ACL: accept group=
  This addition augments id->auth with a fourth array member which is the
  user's group.
- defined, then promptly obsoleted and introduced a new api for MODULE_TYPES
  (see server/modules/misc/contenttypes.pike for short docs), modified
  server/base_server/configuration.pike:type_from_filename() so that it now

  any warning to the user. Now it displays in red on the HTML output.
- Added a link to the caudium.info website from the CIF.

  properly. 
- It is now possible to unset more than one variable at a time by using globs,
  both normal variable of the &form; scope and those of the &var; scrope. 
  Undefine of defines, tags and containers also works with globs. Patch #536492

  (cf bugs #514651 & #512647) then change it to Off/Conditional.

- Fixed bugs #514651 & #512647 : Scopes compatibility break RXML
- Fixed bug #514653 : Unitialized variables get backtraces when try to
  expr them (same code : <formoutput><set variable=GT expr="#GT# + #Z#">
