Changes since last Roxen Challenger 1.3
-----------------------------------------------
+ Caudium is a Roxen Challenger 1.3 fork. We have different goals and
  ideas on what needs to be done. Check out our website at
  http://caudium.net/ for further information.
+ Now works with Pike 7. Not completely tested but at least everything
  seems to compile ok.
+ Wrote query-string and HTTP header parsers in C. Seems to give a
  nice performance boast.
+ Fixed small bug in htmlparse.pike when using tags that return a
  string directly.
+ Added PiXSL, a glue to Sablotron (XSLT parser) and UltraLog, a log
  parser, to the default distribution.
+ Pike not isn't built as part of the server, but instead you specify
  which Pike you want to use (or use the default one).
