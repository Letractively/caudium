Changes in Caudium 1.3 since Caudium 1.2.1
------------------------------------------
- Added support for RFC 3236 (XHTML media type)
- Fix an error when PUT method is used...
- Variable HTTPS is set to "on" when SSL is used. (compatibility variable 
  used for CGIs...)
- Webdav protocol implementation (RFC 2518) added. Not finished yet
- Added a -DMAX_BODY_SIZE=<size> option for starting caudium. The default size
  for the body is 16k otherwise. 
- Updated the error message that occured when the user want to list the open 
  ports in the CIF and Caudium does not run as root.
- svg/svgz file image format handling.
- Fix a problem when Caudium is not running as root : display a warning if 
  the user tries to run lsof in open ports action tab.
- The Generate a self signed certificate and a RSA key-pair was not delivering
  any warning to the user. Now it displays in red on the HTML output.
- Added a link to the caudium.info website from the CIF.
- 404 handler is not set per default on Old 404 system. To avoid 1.0 -> 1.2    
  compatiblity and keep the XML-Compliant parser quiet. 
- Fixed #530674: passive mode FTP connection problem (with Mozilla  
  and derivative browsers).
- <if exists="file"> shouldn't use the cache. Thanks ot Hirling Endre.
- The start script now changes the cwd to the directory it is started from.
  Prevents beginners from crying.
- Fixed bug #547354 - <aconf> URIs don't work
- Fixed bug #542177 that makes incorrect listings from directories2.pike.
- Fixed bug #514391 (user listing in userfs), seems that Caudium Cache.
- Fixed bug #533861 <wizard> was broken. Autodocs now added, new features like
  formname attribute to wizard conatiner, hidden "verify" container.
- SSL.pmod used is the one from Pike now. This verification is now done
  when configure script is ran.
- Caudium 1.3 now *REQUIRES* pike 7.2+ or more recent (7.2.xxx with xxx > 200).
- Fixed the Last-Modified code in http.pike and http2.pike. If the request is
  not marked as dynamic (!id->misc->is_dynamic), then the header will be sent 
  properly. 
- It is now possible to unset more than one variable at a time by using globs,
  both normal variable of the &form; scope and those of the &var; scrope. 
  Undefine of defines, tags and containers also works with globs. Patch #536492
  from disumu.
- Added patch #534125 to ultralog that check the file exist before set 
  filewatch and a status of the module.
- Added patch #534118 that fix for TYPE_FILE and TYPE_DIR checks.
- Half fixed bug #533124. There is no backtrace but I'm not really pleased 
  by the way how it is fixed...
- Fixed bug #530674
- Added support for Darwin (MacOS X) dynamic loading and correct pic flag for it.
- business graphics module now creates the cache directory in the correct
  location (under the argument_cache_dir hierarchy)
- Now font name can be specified in <diagram > tag and use the CIF default
  font name.
- Scopes compatibility is to On/Conditional. If there is problems about that
  (cf bugs #514651 & #512647) then change it to Off/Conditional. 
  Changes is due because there will more issues from users moving from
  Caudium 1.0 to 1.2 than Roxen 1.3 to Caudium 1.3...
- Fixed bug #515131 : gtext broke on weird URLs
- Bill Welliver's Mailit! module is now included into Caudium.

  http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html), error pages was able to
  send abitrary code to browser using non existant pages (like for example :
  http://www.foo.server/<script>alert("CSS");</script>).
- Fixed bugs #514651 & #512647 : Scopes compatibility break RXML
- Fixed bug #514653 : Unitialized variables get backtraces when try to
  expr them (same code : <formoutput><set variable=GT expr="#GT# + #Z#">
  </formoutput> was give backtrace if either GT or Z was not previously
  initialized).
- File index.rxml is now recognized as index file.
