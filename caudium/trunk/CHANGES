Changes in Caudium 1.5.1 since Caudium 1.4.1
---------------------------------------------
- Fixed some Caudium.nbio code that where still used in socket.pike
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Properly decode UTF-8 requests that have been HTTP encoded.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Fix for the 2GB file limit in Caudium.nbio, which should allow
   big files to be transmitted now.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Fix in protocols/http that inadvertantly caused modules using
   HTTP.pipe_in_progress() to drop the connection with the client.
   In particular, this should fix problems in proxy modules,
   but other modules may see an impact as well.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Streaming mode now works in HTTP Relay Module.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Added support for Bonjour Advertisement of virtual servers. 
   Available under Virtual Server Global Variables. Uses either
   the virtual server config name, or the "virtual server name" 
   setting under Global Variables (click on "More Options to 
   show this option.) Available when Pike is compiled with
   DNS_SD support, available on MacOSX/Darwin and systems with
   Howl installed.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Added new showcolumns argument for <sqltable> (Caudium bug id #19, patch
  by Hex).
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Fixed errors in russian translations (Caudium bug id #18)
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Fixed _Caudium C module to compile with a non threaded Pike.
   (Xavier Beaudouin / Michel Luczak) 
- FastCGI module automatically kills any FastCGIs it created when 
   the module stops. This should eliminate "stranded" FCGIs.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Fixes for <user> tag when working with new authentication system.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Group functionality can be disabled in SQL Authentication Provider
   (Bill Welliver)
- Added vhs_syslogger module to log using Syslog to local or distant host
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Fixed bug #17 (ultralog not working on 1.5)
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Fixed syslog to work as it is advertized on CIF
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Fixed emit->maxrows and emit->skiprows
   (Bill Welliver)
- Added emit->sort_function and emit->sort_key to sort query results
   Example usage: sort_function="Array.oid_sort_func" sort_key="version"
   where sort_function is the name of a function compatible with 
   Array.sort_array, and sort_key is the name of a field in the resultset 
   to sort by.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Backported VHS SQLogger from 1.2. Same warnings as for 1.4 branch....
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Fixed bug #11
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Because of changes in Pike 7.6.24+ that have been not compatible with
  it self, we requires now 7.6.24 now.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Fix installation script that has been stop to work with pike 7.6.24+
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Add Index redirect files option that allow people that use L7 load balancers
  to redirect to files that have been specified instead of listing the
  directory.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Fix error on vhs_dirparser when there is no files on directory and that
  option "show dot files" is set to no
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- The watchdog now really take care of the port configuration for each virtual
  server instead of guessing it from the server URI. As a consequence, the
  watchdog can now check multiple HTTP ports for a virtual server.
  Checks are made on the protocol used as well as on the binded interface
  before adding a new virtual server/port to the watch list.
  This fixes a bug where the watchdog would restart Caudium ever and ever on a
  fresh install until some virtual server binds to the port 80.
   (Bertrand LUPART)
- Fixed a watchdog backtrace on fresh install when there are no virtual server
  set up in the CIF, yet.
   (Bertrand LUPART)
- Starting Caudium with --gdb now turns the watchdog off.
   (Bertrand LUPART)
- Some work on accessed-sql:
  - now 2nd level virtual hosting safe
	- fix for a first loading bug that required to restart Caudium
	- now possible to use <counter add="0"> for not incrementing the counter
   (Bertrand LUPART)
- _Caudium.getip() call to get interfaces names and ips for *BSD flavors.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- <if> no longer evaluates true if using the "element is value" syntax and the
  element is not present.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Fixed a backtrace during load of the WebApp module.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Watchdog debug can be enabled using --watchdog-debug
   (Bertrand Lupart)
- If set using HTTP GET, the watchdog can now be set up either to check every
  1st level virtual server or either only the first one.
   (Bertrand Lupart)
- The watchdog can now check virtual servers using HTTP GET
   (Bertrand Lupart)
- The id->variables isn't set as before regarding variables with emtpy values,
  this broke the screen for adding a new virtual server.
   (Bertrand Lupart)
- Watchdog PID check can now be disabled with --without-watchdog-pidcheck
  It is disabled by default on Linuxes < 2.6, since their threads
  implementations assigned different PIDs for each thread.
   (Bertrand Lupart)
- Fixed backtrace when using <accessed since> or <accessed help> when accessed
  was handled by accessed-sql or accessed-memory.
   (Bertrand Lupart)
- Not using strftime on solaris as it does not support the POSIX %z flag
  which rendered Caudium.cern_http_date() unusable.
   (Marek Habersack)
- The id->variables wasn't set as before regarding empty values, this broke
  some applications and most notably lead to internal server error when
  reseting a variable in the configuration interface.
   (David Gourdelier)
- Comparing of empty strings didn't work in RXML so this lead to wrong
  <if match...>
   (David Gourdelier)
- Fix for the RXML parsers sending the wrong content-type header when parsing
  a non-html document.
   (James Tyson)
- Pikegraphy now likes filenames with spaces.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Watchdog should now work with servers that change uid.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Stopping/restarting of server should work properly now, especially for servers that change uid.
   (Bill Welliver)
- Fix a backtrace in Config-Action openports when there is no lsof located 
  on the hosted machine.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Fixed loading of Crypto related Configuration Actions in CIF.
   (Xavier Beaudouin)
- Fixed a segfault in Caudium C module when broken variable assignments
  in the query part of the url are parsed (eg ?foo=too&hop=&gazon=zz - hop= 
  is the invalid syntax), SF bug #1028622
   (Marek Habersack)
