Changes in Caudium 1.3 since Caudium 1.2.1
------------------------------------------
- Fixed bug #530674
- Added support for Darwin (MacOS X) dynamic loading and correct pic flag for it.
- business graphics module now creates the cache directory in the correct
  location (under the argument_cache_dir hierarchy)
- Now font name can be specified in <diagram > tag and use the CIF default
  font name.
- Scopes compatibility is to On/Conditional. If there is problems about that
  (cf bugs #514651 & #512647) then change it to Off/Conditional. 
  Changes is due because there will more issues from users moving from
  Caudium 1.0 to 1.2 than Roxen 1.3 to Caudium 1.3...
