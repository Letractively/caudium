  Tomcat and Jetty servlet engines.
- <if group="somegroup"> now consults the new naming system for group 
  membership information, as well as the groupfile option.
- LDAP and SQL authentication sources have been completely rewritten, 
  with incompatible settings. Users of these authentication sources will 
  need to check their settings when these modules are upgraded.
- Authentication and naming system has been completely rewritten. The 
  system consists of a Master handler and one or more stackable 
  authentication source providers. The new system also provides built in 
  access to groups and group membership information. The new 
  authentication system  provides new APIs, the existing APIs have been  
  deprecated. Virtual servers that utilize existing authentication modules 
  will be upgraded to the new system automatically on the first startup.
- An automatic upgrade system is in place, for updating settings that may 
  have incompatably changed between releases. A global variable "Upgrade 
  Performed?" allows the upgrade procedure to be run manually on the next 
  restart. Output messages are sent to the debug log and the CIF Event log.
- Changed Cache API slightly to make programming easier.
- Added some wrappers to parse_html() and parse_html_lines() that are
  called Caudium.parse_html() and Caudium.parse_html_lines(). This wrapper
  is Wide Strings complian (eg >8 bits compatible) and is set per default.
  If you have bugs with it, please send it to bugs@caudium.info. You can
  use the old parser from spider module (Pike) by starting Caudium with
  OLD_SPIDER define set.
- Headline module has been removed. This was mostly a hack from Headline
  module from David Hedbor (see roxen community for that) and it is too
  buggy and not really clean.
- Caudium.so pike glue in now _Caudium. A Pike module library is here to handle
  all functions that are coded in C or in Pike or that uses both things.
- Fix a bug with icons and virtual directories like /mail/ in gbutton module.

------------------------------------------

- IP Less module is now in server/deprecated_modules. Don't forget to add this
  to you module list if you still need it.
