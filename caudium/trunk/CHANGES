Changes in Caudium 1.1 since CVS branching
-----------------------------------------------
- Added embedded Perl script / perl tag support from Roxen, originally
  ported to Caudium by Jan Legenhausen.
- Made the ftp protocol use supplied error code if it's present after a
  command fails. This leads to more helpful error messages than
  "file not found'.
- filesystem.pike improvements:
  - Removed the stat cache completely. It's not any major benefit
    unless you have a dog slow system / disk with lots of requests and
    even then it has questionable benefits. The gain of using it is
    also very small.
  - Organized options in sub-levels for easier overview.
  - Added default settings for umask as well as new file and directory
    modes.
  - Added an option to keep the permissions on files replacing by an
    upload.
  - Made the access method configuration finer grained. Now you can
    disable individual features like chmod and mkdir.
    COMPATIBILITY ALERT: Before the PUT method permission was used for
    the new features. This is no longer true and therefor server which
    allows PUT needs to enable the CHMOD, MKDIR and MV after
    upgrading!
- Removed htmlparse dependency from the Enhanced Directory Listings
  module since we have two parsing modules now.
- Quote the chars < > @ in http_encode_url and http_encode_string.
- added the excellent gbutton.pike module from Roxen 2.x
- Added processing instructions in the XML parser. This is tags using the
  syntax <?tagname contents ?>. Current existing processing instructions are
  <?pike ?> (Pike tag module), <?comment ?> (rxmltags), <?perl ?>
  (perl module).
