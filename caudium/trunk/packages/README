This directory is meant to keep all the packaging systems stuff.
If you are a maintainer of Caudium package for some OS distribution,
be it Linux, Solaris, whatever - you should put your files here.

A quick howto:

 - create a directory named after your distribution, e.g.:
     redhat/
     debian/	[ actually don't do debian/. debian packaging	]
		[ info is already in the tree, where it belongs	]
		[ to according to debian standards. do the	]
		[ others, though... //ice			]
     solaris/
     mandrake/
     
 - put all your files there
