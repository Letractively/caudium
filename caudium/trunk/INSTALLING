          Installing Caudium 1.0 from source:
          +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  1. Get the source server package.

  2. Issue the command to unpack the archive:

          .tar.gz:
               If you have GNU tar; "tar xzf Caudium-archive-name"
               If you don't have GNU tar: 
               "gunzip < Caudium-archive-name| tar xf -" 
          .tar.Z
               If you have GNU tar; "tar xzf Caudium-archive-name"
               If you don't have GNU tar: 
               "uncompress < Caudium-archive-name| tar xf -"
          .tar
               "tar xf Caudium-archive-name"

     (where "Caudium-archive-name" is the name of the Caudium archive
     file.).

  3. Type "cd <caudium_version>" to change to the new directory. This
     directory should contain at the very least four directories:
     server (Caudium server source), src (extra pike modules), extern
     (misc. programs used by Caudium) and tools (misc tools). See README
     for more information about the directory structure.

     (Where caudium_version is the name of the unarchived Caudium directory.)

 4.  Type ./configure --prefix=<wanted_base_path_for_caudium>
     (prefix is optional and defaults to /usr/local, thus placing Caudium in
     /usr/local/caudium/) followed by make and make install to build
     the binaries and copy them to the correct place.

!!!  By default, the configuration will fail if the Sablotron XSLT
!!!  library isn't found. If you are not interested in XSLT
!!!  functionality, just add the flag '--without-PiXSL' to the
!!!  configure script.

     You can later on move the 'caudium' directory that will be
     created when you type 'make install' to anywhere in your
     filesystem. Caudium does not keep any absolute paths.
     
  5. If everything worked fine and the compilation is done, type 
     cd <dir>/server.

     (Where <wanted_base_path_for_caudium>/caudium if you used 4.)

  6. Start the install script by typing ./install.

  7. Answer the simple questions and wait for your client.

  9. If everything worked, configure the server, otherwise move on to the
     troubleshooting section on the Caudium WWW-pages. 

 Once you have installed the server, consider joining the Caudium
 mailinglist (by sending a mail to caudium-request@caudium.net, with
 Subject: subscribe).
