--- TODO Urgent project ---

Use _r function if they are present in system instead of plain function
in C modules, especialy _Caudium module.

 Summary :

  localtime() -> localtime_r() : WIP
  gmtime()    -> gmtime_r()    : TODO


--- TODO (more long term projects..)

** This one is from Roxen and might be more or less out of date. I
** opted to keep it since there are still some good ideas here. Go to
** our Sourceforge task managed at http://sourceforge.net/pm/?group_id=8825 
** to view current plans and ideas. Feel free to give us more ideas of
** what should be done.


o  SSL authentification

> #       AUTH_TYPE       "ssl"
> #       CLIENT_CERT     the client's certificate
> #                       (base64 encoded DER X.509 certificate
> #       REMOTE_USER     the user name to which the cert was mapped.
>
> and any additional directives to use with apache_SSL:
>
> e.g.
> 
> <Limit GET>
> require valid-client_cert
> </limit>


o Support netmasks everywhere where ip-patterns are now
  supported. Preferably using the xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/mask syntax, like:
  130.236.253.0/24, and 194.52.182.64/26.

o "Bookmarks" in the configuration interface (it is, of course,
  possible to use _actual_ bookmarks in your browser, but then at least
  Netscape insists on cacheing the page).

o The possibility for modules to add their own buttons to the
  configuration interface. This code is still present in some parts of
  Roxen, namely the register_module() event callback.

o <modified duration[=year|months|weeks|days|hours|seconds|auto]>
  This page was last changed <modified type=string duration=auto> ago.
  -> This page was last changed five hours ago
  -> This page was last changed six days ago

o Use netscape Live Script and/or Java in the configuration interface
  if it is supported by the browser.

o Disclaimer module. From Josh Wilmes <wilmesj@rpi.edu>:
 
  Is there a way to force roxen to insert a piece of html code at the 
  bottom of all documents from a given directory?
 
  I'd like to force a disclaimer link onto some of my pages.

o From: Bernhard Reiter <breiter@mathematik.Uni-Osnabrueck.DE>
  Subject: Idea for Roxen configuration interface
 
  I haven`t looked in the latest b15 configuration interface,
  but i think that it is lacking 
 
  A summary list of modules and their priorities.
 
  And maybe their calling sequence and security parameters.
 
  A few summary lists could make the use of priority levels a lot
  easier.
  
o Fix a better page for "Illegal configuration name". It should at least offer
  a "back"-button

Fixed:

o Allow multiple 'tags' with the same name
