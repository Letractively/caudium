Pike Headline Viewer version 0.2
--------------------------------

  This is a little Pike/GTK headline viewer. It is the beginning of a
  replacement program for my Slashdot reader. This, the second
  release, is still far from a finished product but now it's at least
  usable. There are now 25 sites supported.

  All programming by David Hedbor (david@hedbor.org).


Install / Usage information:
------------------

  Just run headlines.pik from the unpacked directory. If you want to
  install it, put the unpacked directory somewhere, like
  /usr/local/share/headlines, and change the path in the headlines
  script to reflect this. Then put headlines in for example /usr/local/bin/.

  If Pike 0.7 isn't in your PATH or if it isn't the first "pike" in
  your PATH, enter the correct pike path in headlines.pike.

  The command menu has all normal commands in it, with key
  shortcuts. If you left click on a headline, a browser (netscape) is
  spawned with the headline URL. The right mouse button gives a menu
  that varies from site to site. 

Licensing:
----------

  Use it any way you want, but if it causes a space shuttle to crash,
  it's not my fault. If you want to use any of the code for your own
  project, please contact me first. 


Availability: 
-------------

  Now and then I will upload new versions here to Pike Community, in
  the hacks section. Eventually I will make a site there for it.
  The URL to Pike Community is http://pike-community.org/.

  It is also available from anonymous read-only CVS from:
	
	:pserver:anon@bloodberry.idonex.se:/cvs

  The password is empty (just press return) and the name of the
  reposity is "headlines". The distributed version comes with the CVS
  directories so a cvs update (and a cvs login if you haven't used the
  above server before) should get you the latest code. As always, the
  checked in code might not actually be working, even though I try not
  to check in non-working stuff.


Software Requirements:
----------------------

  You will need Pike 0.7 with thread support. It's available from the
  same CVS server as this program. You will also need PiGTK 1.1.2 or
  newer (GTK bindings for Pike), which you can get from from
  http://pike-community.org/sites/pigtk/. PiGTK requires GTK
  1.1.13 or newer.

  There is also a no-gtk program that can dump headlines from any of
  the supported sites, but it's more of a debug program than anything.


Additional CVS Information:
---------------------------

  See http://david.hedbor.org/tmp/fromcvs.html for instructions on how
  to get Pike 0.7 from CVS.
