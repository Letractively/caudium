//! module: Virtual Host Matcher
//!  hostmatch.pike - host header regexp -> host header/virt site remap
//!  This module is used for virtual hosting. It's like the IP Less
//!  virtual hosting module but better. Instead of relying on flaky
//!  fuzzy matching, this module uses regexps to rewrite the host header
//!  and then does an exact match on the result. No rules or no matched
//!  rules uses exact matching on the host header.
//!  <p><strong>Please note that  ip less hosting
//!  doesn't work well together with proxies. The reason is that the
//!  host header sent isn't the one of the proxy server, but the
//!  one of the requested host. We strongly  recommend having the
//!  proxies in their own virtual server with a dedicated
//!  IP and / or port.</strong></p>
