//
// Never enclose the message in double quotes! Below are few escape sequences
// you can use in the message text:
//
// \s - space (needed at the start and the end of message since the parser strips
//             both leading and trailing whitespace)
// \t - TAB (as above)
// \# - # sign (only needed at the start of message if you need it to start with #).
//      # used at the start of message makes this message a function invocation, and
//      not a string. It means that it won't be enclosed in the quotation marks in the
//      output.
//
// Comments starting with //! are "attached" to the message definition that follows them
// and output in the target file as an attachment of that same kind.
//
// The target file contains also another kind of entry market with the //#DIRECTIVE 
// comment. The following directives are defined:
//
//  ORIG - the line contains the original version of the string for change testing when
//         the translation and the template are combined.
//  FLAG - followed by several flags marks the state of this entry:
//           <changed>  - the entry has been changed in the original (default) file
//                        and the translation needs to be updated.
//           <new>      - new entry merged from the default file
//
//  Neither the attachment comment nor the directive comment should be edited by hand!!
//

// Internal for the translation system!!!! NOT USED BY CAMAS!!!
