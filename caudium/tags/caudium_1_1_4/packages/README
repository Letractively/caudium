This directory is meant to keep all the packaging systems stuff.
If you are a maintainer of Caudium package for some OS distribution,
be it Linux, Solaris, whatever - you should put your files here.

A quick howto:

 - create a directory named after your distribution, e.g.:
     redhat/
     debian/
     solaris/
     mandrake/
     
 - put all your files there
