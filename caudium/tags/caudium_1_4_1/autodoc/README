Notes for the Caudium autodoc
-----------------------------

We use the Pike 7.3+ autodoc system to produce documentation of the Caudium
Pike/C API. The bin/ directory contains all the original Pike files that
had to be modified in order to work with Caudium. The system processes only
the Pike API calls - it does NOT understand the Caudium
defvars/tags/containers for now. This is in the TODO :)

To generate the documentation you will need the following software:

1. Pike 7.3 sources
2. Pike 7.3 binaries
3. GNU Autoconf 2.5x+
4. GNU Make

Run the provided autogen.sh then invoke the generated configure script
passing it the path to the Pike 7.3 source tree:

./configure --with-pikesrc=/usr/src/pike-7.3

optionally you can pass the configure script a path to the pike binary it
should use using the --with-pike parameter.
