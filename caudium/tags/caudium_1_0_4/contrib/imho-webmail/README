imho-0_97_1.diff.bz2 :

 This is the patch against imho 0.97.1 provided in this directory.
 My employeer use this modified version of IMHO on our production servers
 for more than 50000 users. So it is a quite stable.

imho-0_98.diff.bz2 :
 
 This is the patch against imho 0.98 provided in this directory
 Since imho 0.98 seems to works only on Roxen 2.0, we didn't upgrade
 our servers to roxen 2.0, we didn't go more far.

imho_french.diff.bz2 :

 This is a patch to french language for 0.97.1 (and maybe 0.98, but this
 is not tested yet !) with a better and more "end user" french. The wording
 is better and less technical than the original one...
