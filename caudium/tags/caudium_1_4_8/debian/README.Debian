Caudium Webserver for Debian
----------------------------

 The default configuration now forbids access to the configuration
 interface from IPs other than 127.0.0.1. That means, to access the
 configuration interface remotely, you will need to use SSH port
 forwarding or use (e)links/lynx locally (for that elinks is recommended)
