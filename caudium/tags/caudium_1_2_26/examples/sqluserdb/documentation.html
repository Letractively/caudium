<H1 align=center>SQL User Authentication Module for Roxen/1.2</H1>

<H2 align=center>Preamble</H2>
This module fills a hole in Roxen capabilities, and completes the options
an user has in adiministering its site. 
In particular, it handles authentication data stored in a SQL database.<BR>

<H2 align=center>Design Issues</H2>
This module exploits Pike's unique ability to use an uniform interface
to all supported databases. These currently options include
<A href="http://www.hughes.com.au/">MiniSQL</A>,
<A href="http://www.tcx.se/">MySql</A>,
<A href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSql</A>. Commercial
extensions should cover Ingres and Oracle.<P>
While the interface is consistent, unluckily not all those databases
follow ANSI SQL specifications except for very simple queries. This means that
I couldn't automate the database creation process, short of following every
SQL dialect of the supported servers.<BR>
This module can do pretty everything, from simple authentication to driving
an user filesystem or a named FTP server. The last is however deprecated,
since too many security issues are at stake with this approach.

<H2 align=center>Setup</H2>
In this description, I assume you know the basics of Roxen confguration and
how to use interactively your SQL server.<P>
First off, make sure the Pike interpreter your Roxen server uses supports
the database of your choice. Mysql driver is distributed along with the Pike
interpreter, Msql and Postgres are not. You can fetch them at
<A href="ftp://ftp.infovav.se/pub/pike/contrib/">the Roxen FTP site</A>.
Follow the instruction therein contained to build and install your new
interpreter should it be needed.<BR>
Copy the <TT>SQLuserdb.pike</TT> file in a directory where Roxen can
find it (see the Roxen configuration Interface), and then add it to
the virtual server of your choice. Remember there can be only one
user authentication module per virtual server.<BR>
Connect to your SQL server, and create a new database. Make sure to grant
the user running the WWW server enough privileges to read the database.<BR>
Notice that the database server doesn't necesarily have to be on the
same host. The host where the database resides, its name and the name of
the table containing the authorization information are configurable, so
you don't have to worry about this at this time. <BR>
Let's suppose that the table is called <TT>passwd</TT>, it must have
<B>at least</B> these column definitions (these are simil-SQL, you'll
have to adapt them to your SQL server's syntax:
<UL>
<LI><TT>username</TT>
<DD>A string or variable-length string. Must be <B>primary key</B>, or
 at least <B>unique index</B>
<LI><TT>passwd</TT>
<DD>A string long exactly 13 characters, must be <B>not null</B>
<LI><TT>uid</TT>
<DD>integer
<LI><TT>gid</TT>
<DD>integer
<LI><TT>homedir</TT>
<DD>A string. I suggest a varchar, long at least 20-30 characters. If it 
 can grow, better.
<LI><TT>shell</TT>
<DD>A string. I suggest a varchar, like for homedir
</UL>
<DIV align=center>
<TABLE border=2 width=60%>
<CAPTION>Example: mSQL 2.0 table definition</CAPTION>
<TR><TD>
<PRE>
CREATE TABLE passwd (
	username char(15) NOT NULL,
	passwd char(13) NOT NULL,
	uid int,
	gid int,
	homedir text(20),
	shell text(10)
)

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX pass_index ON passwd (
	username
)
</PRE>
</TABLE>
</DIV>
Notice that you may want to have more tables or more columns for administrative
tasks. It is of course possible.<BR>
We're almost done. Now you only need to check the default values in the
configuration interface.

<H2 align=center>Configuration</H2>
It is pretty straightforward.
<UL>
<LI>Cache entries
<DD>defines whether the
 module should cache in memory decoded password entries. This will allow
 a good performance gain (remember that unless you're running a multithreaded
 Roxen, the server blocks while looking up the database, so it could become
 a serious bottleneck on a busy site. I recommend to leave it on.
<LI>Close the database if not used
<DD>Keeping an unused connection to the database uses one filedescriptor
 and some computing power both on the client side (Roxen) and on the
 server side. If this is set, the database connection will be closed
 if it is idle for more than an amount of time.
<LI>Database close timer
<DD>This is the inactivity timeout for the database connection. You'll have
 to find a balance for your site with this setting: opening a connection
 to the database takes some overhead, so you'll want to keep in somewhat
 high. At the same time, having this too high means you'll have no
 profit from it. I believe (but have no solid proof) that a timeout of
 60 (seconds) or so is best.
<LI>Defaults...
<DD>These are the values returned for users who haven't set theirs: only 
 username and password are mandatory, and you could have no interest in
 the others. However, the database columns must be there, but can be
 left empty. These values are returned in such a case.
<LI>Disable userlist
<DD>In some cases Roxen asks the authorization module a list of all the
 user it knows, for example to print a directory listing of an userfilesystem
 mountpoint. If you have an huge user list, and are not interested
 in such features, you may want to have this flag turned on: memory is
 a scarce resource, and its allocation and deallocation a long task.
<LI>SQL server...
<DD>These are the settings about the server: where it is, what table it
 should use and the authentication information.
</UL>

<H2 align=center>Let's start</H2>
Okay. Your authentication server is now hopefully set up. All you need is
fill in the entries, and test it.<BR>
You will probably want to write your customized application/CGI script/pike
script/whatever to correctly fill in the entries. Especially since you'll
probably have extra administrative information to manage.<BR>
The program <TT>adduser</TT> can be used if such is not the case, or
as an example. It simply interactively adds (or changes) user entries
on the table <TT>passwd</TT> in database <TT>passwd</TT> on whatever
server runs on localhost<P>
The fields <TT>uid</TT> and <TT>gid</TT> are <B>deprecated</B>. It's in
my opinion simply too dangerous to use them. The only use I can
think of for them is to drive a named ftp upload. This is DANGEROUS!
I will never stress it enough. <BR>
My suggestion is to set the "noobody" user
and group in the configuration interface and leave these entries in the
database empty. Also, I'm afraid to say that for implementation reasons,
user ID 0 and group ID 0 (root/root) <B>are not availible</B>. Given
the premises, I don't think I'll ever try to implement a way aroud this.

<H2 align=center>Bugs</H2>
Bugs? What are those? &lt;grin&gt;<BR>
Seriously. Should you notice strange behaviours, first off check your
setup, your SQL server, your authentication.<BR>
Should you find in your debug/default.1 log messages of "cannot open server for
unknown reason", it's quite likely that you have permission problems or
that your SQL server is down.<BR>
If you're VERY SURE everything is fine, try to uncomment the 
<CODE>#define SQLAUTHDEBUG</CODE> line at the beginning of the module and
reload the module.
This will produce a lot of debugging output in the default.1 file.<BR>
Should everything else fail, <A href="mailto:kinkie@kame.usr.dsi.unimi.it">send me</A>
a mail trying to describe exactly what the problem is and I'll see what
I can do.

<H2 align=center>Final notes</H2>
This module, accompanying documentation and tools are <B>free software</B>.
That means, you can use, copy, distribute them freely. Money donations to
the author are of course welcome, but not required. My oversized ego
however forces me to ask you to 
<A href="mailto:kinkie@kame.usr.dsi.unimi.it">write me</A> if you find this program
useful. This will not make me richer, but will for sure encourage me to
write more, better software, and won't cost you one bit ^_^<BR>
I hope my work will be useful, and to hear from you soon.<P>
