INTRODUCTION:
-------------

PiXSL is a Pike glue for Sablotron, an XSLT parser. In the package is
the Pike module source (the glue), a command line Pike program, pixsl,
and modules for Roxen. See below for links to these products.


INSTALL:
--------

Installation should be pretty straight forward. In the examples below,
<prefix> is the Roxen prefix directory, which per default is /usr/local/

To install for use with a Roxen 1.3, follow these steps:
	cd Sablotron
	./configure --with-pike=<prefix>/bin/pike-roxen
	make
	make install
	cp ../modules/*.pike <prefix>/roxen/local/modules/

To install for use with a Roxen 2.x, follow these steps:
	cd Sablotron
	./configure --with-pike=<prefix>/roxen/server/bin/pike
	make
	make install
	cp ../modules/*.pike <prefix>/roxen/local/modules/

To install for stand-alone pike usage:
	./configure
	make
	make install

If your stand-alone pike is not in your path, or you want to use a
different pike, use the --with-pike argument as in the Roxen
examples.
