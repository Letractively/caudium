Pike is easy to learn, and just as easy to use in the development of
powerful applications. The language is designed to be useful and
powerful. As the syntax of Pike is similar to that of C, most
programmers will find it easy to use. As Pike is a high-level,
interpreted and modular object-oriented language, powerful
applications can be rapidly developed. Pike has evolved rather than
been designed, and the changes made have been guided by its users'
needs. In general, the better you get to know Pike, the more you will
appreciate it, from a user's perspective.
