<b>&lt;stream ...&gt; &lt;playlist ...&gt; ... &lt;/ &gt; &lt;/ &gt;</b>
<blockquote>
	The <i>stream</i> container is used to create a new stream with fishcast.<br>
	When this tag is parsed by the RXML parser and found to be corrent
	then the fishcast module creates a new <i>reader thread</i> to read
	mp3 files off the local filesystem.<br>
	The available arguments are:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>name</b>	They name of the stream being created.
									if unspecified then a value of &quot;Unknown Stream&quot;
									is used.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>genre</b>	The style of music being streamed. Highly subjective.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>url</b>	The URL for information about this stream.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>bitrate</b>	The bitrate in KB/s to force MP3 streaming to.
											If specified this tells the reader to skip streaming
											of any mp3 files that are off a different bitrate
											than specified. This <i>will not work</i> for mp3's
											with variable bitrates, as only the first mpeg header
											encountered in the file is used.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>action=playlist</b>	This tells the parser to return a link to a dynamically
															generated playlist file, which is more browser/player
															friendly than just linking to the stream. This is the 
															default action if no actions are specified.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>action=stream_id</b>	This tells the parser to return the ID of the
															stream (a long string of numbers), which is used
															to uniquely identify the stream.
		</li>
  </ul>
	<br>
	The <i>playlist</i> container is used within the stream tag and should
	contain a list of files (\n delimited) to use to create the actual playlist
	of mp3's. Please note that the search path is specified in the configuration
	interface, and as such you should only place relative paths in the playlist.<br>
	Please also note that the playlists are used to compare subsequent occurances
	of the <b>stream</b> container in order to know whether to create a new
	stream. This means that you can't have two different streams with the same
	playlist (irrespective of their order).<br>
	The available arguments are:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>shuffle</b>	Shuffle the playlist instead of playing them as they are
											listed in the contents of the tag.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>loop</b>	Loop the playlist forever, over and over again. Otherwise
									the stream will be stopped after running though once. Please
									note that if both the <b>loop</b> and <b>shuffle</b>
									arguments are specified then the playlist will be shuffled
									anew with each iteration.
		</li>
	</ul>
