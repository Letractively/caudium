<kbd><b>{quote start=character end=character}:</b></kbd>
Sets the 'end' and 'start' quote characters.<p>

Warning: This function is not thread-safe, and might behave
unexpectedly when used in a threaded roxen on several different pages,
using several different quote characters. The only safe use is to use
a standard begin and endquote, start='[' end=']', as an example,
please note that you have to quote the quote characters, since utter
caos would be the result the second time you use this tag
otherwise. Consider:<p>

{quote start=[ end=]}
{quote start=[ end=]}
<p>
The second time this code is run, the starting quote character would
be set to ' '.
