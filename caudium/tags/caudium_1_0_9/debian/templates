Template: caudium/experimental_http
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Use the experimental HTTP protocol module?
 Caudium comes with an experimental HTTP module that is faster than
 the original one. The code is still Work-In-Progress, so you might
 experience problems running it. It is NOT recommended to run this
 code on a production server. If, however, you want to test its 
 functionality, answer YES to this question.
