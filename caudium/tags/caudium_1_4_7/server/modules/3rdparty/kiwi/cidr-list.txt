# This file is used with CIDR Filesystem and redirector Caudium Module.
#
# Syntax is :
#
# CIDR		ACTION		ACTION ARGUMENT
#
# With :
#
# CIDR : a CIDR network number eg 192.168.10.0/24
# ACTION : 
#   DIR      -> a directory related to Search Path wher files exist
#   REDIRECT -> redirect to the specified URL in ACTION ARGUMENT
# ACTION ARGUMENT : Arguments given to the specified action.
#
# Example:
#
# 192.168.0.0/24	DIR	private-old-network/
# 10.5.0.0/15		REDIRECT	http://www.yahoo.com/
#
# ***** NOTICE *******
# 
# If you add several network CIDR that can be both eligible for an action
# you can get random results. A good example for that random thing is 
# 192.168.0.0/24 and 192.168.0.3/32. The result for 192.168.0.3/32 can 
# be elected on 2 rules. So you can get random results.
# You have been warned for that now.
