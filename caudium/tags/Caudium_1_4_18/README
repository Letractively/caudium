Caudium 1.4
+++++++++++

About
----
Caudium is a modern, fast and extensible WWW server derived from Roxen.
Caudium is by default compatible with Roxen 1.3 although some incompatible
options, mostly introduced to improve the performance, security etc. of the
server, can be turned on.
Caudium features built-in log parsing engine (UltraLog), XSLT parser, native
PHP4 support, multiple execution threads and many more features - see
http://caudium.net/ and http://caudium.org/ for more information.

Upgrading
---------

If you are upgrading from a previous release of Caudium, you are strongly
encouraged to follow the following instructions in order to ensure the 
upgrade process is completed smoothly.

1. Read the release notes contained in the CHANGES file, noting any 
   changes that may impact your installation, such as incompatible 
   differences between versions. This file may also contain directions
   for dealing with any upgrade issues that may not be handled 
   automatically.

2. Make a backup of your configuration and server directories. The 
   installation process will make a backup of the server directory, but it 
   will only keep the most recent backup copy.

3. Delete the contents of your caudium_cache directory.
