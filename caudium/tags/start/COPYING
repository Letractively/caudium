Sweden has export control laws governing export of cryptographic
software (SFS 1991:341 with additions, where SFS 1994:2060 is
particularly important). It is clear that these laws cover physical
export of software but it is not clear whether these laws also cover
electronic distribution. 'The Inspection for Strategic Products'
(Inspektionen för strategiska produkter tel: +46-(0)8-406 31 00) is
the agency handling export control issues. Please note that these laws
are currently being revised. We do not advise anyone to bring with
him, distribute or export this software outside of Sweden, without
being fully aware of the possible legal consequences.
