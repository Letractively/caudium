// Documentation:
 
// The purpose of this module is to allow comments in the SPML source
// that are invisible to average viewers, but can be seen with the
// right magic incantation.  Fnord!  The special text is rendered in
// the "sample" font, if available, which makes it possible for
// someone looking at the mixed output to distinguish text that is for
// public consumption from that which is restricted.
 
// See also <COMMENT> which is similar, but always removes the
// enclosed text.
 
// If you have a section of text (with markup, if desired) that you
// may be planning on adding later, but don't want to generally
// activate (the pointers may not have all been done, yet) you can use
// this.  It has other uses, too.
 
// This is not a secure way to hide text, I would like to see a
// version that requires authentication to turn on the "hidden" text,
// but this simple version does not do that.
 
// To use this in your SPML, enter the "hidden" text between a <FNORD>
// and </FNORD>, you can include any additional markup you desire.
// You may want to have a <P> or two to set it off, or use
// <BLOCKQUOTE> inside.  Here's a simple example:
 
//      The text that everyone sees. <FNORD>With some they
//      don't.</FNORD> And then some they do.
 
// Since the excised text may be part of a sentence flow, its removal
// may disrupt the readability.  In this case an ALT attribute can be
// used on the FNORD to give text for the mundanes to see.  This text
// should not have markup (some kinds might work, but others might
// not).  Here's an example of how that might be used:
 
//      This server <FNORD ALT="provides">will provide, when we
//      actually get to it,</FNORD> complete source for the ...
 
// The way the normally hidden text is made visible is by including
// "fnord" in the prestates (i.e. add "/(fnord)" before the "filename"
// part of the URL).
