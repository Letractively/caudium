          Installing Roxen Challenger 1.3 - the Source distribution
          +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  1. Get the source server package.

  2. Issue the command to unpack the archive:

          .tar.gz:
               If you have GNU tar; "tar xzf Roxen-archive-name"
               If you don't have GNU tar: 
               "gunzip < Roxen-archive-name| tar xf -" 
          .tar.Z
               If you have GNU tar; "tar xzf Roxen-archive-name"
               If you don't have GNU tar: 
               "uncompress < Roxen-archive-name| tar xf -"
          .tar
               "tar xf Roxen-archive-name"

     (where "Roxen-archive-name" is the name of the Roxen archive
     file.).

  3. Type "cd <roxen_version>" to change to the new directory. This
     directory should contain at the very least four directories:
     server (Roxen server source), pike (the Pike intepreter), extern
     (misc. programs used by Roxen) and tools (misc tools). See README
     for more information about the directory structure.

     (Where roxen_version is the name of the unarchived Roxen directory.)

 4a. Type "make install" to install Roxen Challenger in /usr/local/roxen.

 4b. (This is an alternative method if you want to install Roxen somewhere
      else than /usr/local/roxen, or if method 4a fails.)

     Type ./configure --prefix=<wanted_base_path_for_roxen>
     (defaults to /usr/local, thus placing Roxen in /usr/local/roxen/)
     followed by make and make install to build the binaries and copy them 
     to the correct place.

     You can later on move the 'roxen' directory that will be
     created when you type 'make install' to anywhere in your
     filesystem. Roxen does not keep any absolute paths.
     
  5. If everything worked fine and the compilation is done, type 
     cd <dir>/server.

     (Where <dir> is /usr/local/roxen following 4a, or
      <wanted_base_path_for_roxen>/roxen if you used 4b.)

  6. Start the install script by typing ./install.

  7. Answer the simple questions and wait for your client.

  9. If everything worked, configure the server, otherwise move on to the
     troubleshooting section on the roxen WWW-pages. 

 Once you have installed the server, consider joining the Roxen
 mailinglist (by sending a mail to roxen-request@roxen.com, with
 Subject: subscribe).

Example installation session using the 4b route:

bash$ tar xzf roxen_1.3.tar.gz
bash$ cd roxen_1.3
bash$ mkdir solaris
bash$ cd solaris
bash$ ../configure --prefix=/usr/www

<Lots and lots of checks...>

bash$ make install

<Lots and lots of compilations>

bash$ cd /usr/www/roxen/server
bash$ ./install
<answer a few questions>
