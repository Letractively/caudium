Introduction:
-------------

This is UltraLog, a fast customizable web log parser. It features
customizable log formats, good support for multiple logfiles per
profile and any number of profiles.


Requirements:
-------------

UltraLog requires Pike (http://pike.idonex.se/) for summarization and
the Roxen webserver (http://www.roxen.com) for display. Pike is an
interpreted C-like language in the same league as for example
Python. Roxen is a very nice webserver mainly written in Pike, with
some support functions written in C. 


Installation instructions:
--------------------------

UltraLog has two parts. One is the summarizer, which is written as a
Pike C module with a support program written in Pike. The second part, 
the display module, is written as a Roxen module and thus requires
Roxen.

You should be able to use either Roxen 1.3 / Pike 0.6 or Roxen 2.0 /
Pike 7. The below instructions applies to Roxen 1.3.

*****							 	     *****
*** If you install a version checked out from CVS also read README.cvs ***
*****								     *****

1) Download the source code, available from http://www.roxen.com/.
2) Copy the UltraLog directory to the Pike source module
   directory. This is normally in roxen/pike/0.6/src/modules/.
   
   *** Don't just make a soft link from the directory in the checked
   *** out source, since this might break the building process!   

5) Configure and build Roxen as following these instructions (for
   Roxen 1.3):
	mkdir build
	cd build
	../configure
	make
	make install
4) Configure and start the Roxen webserver.
5) Go to the Roxen configuration interface and add the "modules"
   directory in the ultralog tree to the Global Variable module path
   (for example /home/neotron/ultralog/modules/).
7) Make a save directory, for example /var/ultralog/.
6) Create a new Roxen virtual server and add the UltraLog module and
   configure the correct save directory (and any other variables you
   want to change).
7) Create a configuration file for the summarizer. Here is a very
   basic example:

	<savedir path="/var/ultralog/">
	<table maxsize="5000">

	<profile name="webserver">
		<file path="/usr/local/roxen/logs/webserver/Log">
		<noref for="webserver.com">
		<extensions list="html html shtml cgi pike php3">
 	</profile>

8) Run the summarizer program. If you are running Roxen 1.3/Pike 0.6
   which is installed with prefix /usr/local/ you can do this by running:
    /usr/local/bin/pike-roxen /home/src/ultralog/bin/summarizer.pike cf-file


See the files docs/CONFIG.spec and docs/CUSTOM_LOG.spec for
documentation on the config file format and the custom log file format.
