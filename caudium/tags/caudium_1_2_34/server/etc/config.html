<p>Pressing one of the tabs at the top of the page will select that
section of the configuation interface. Pressing the <em>selected</em>
button will focus on the top node of that part of the interface.<p> It
will probably make sense once you try it. You can always see where in
the configuration interface you are by looking at the grey statusrow
at the top of the page.

<p>There are usually one or more buttons at the bottom of the page, to
do things that do not fit nicely in the 'node with subnodes'
metaphore, like adding a new virtual server, unfolding/folding more
than one node at the time etc, at the top or bottom of the
configuration interface.

<p>

Some buttons, like the 'add a new module' button are only available in
certain nodes (when a node of a certain type has been focused).
