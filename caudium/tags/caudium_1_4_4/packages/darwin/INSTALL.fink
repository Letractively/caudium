For now, the Caudium package hasn't been submitted to the fink community, so
you'll have to download the data from the Caudium FTP.

You have two options: build from source or install precompiled binaries.

While building from source, you can compile Caudium against any Pike >= 7.6.7.
If you want to compile Caudium with another Pike version, just adapt the info
file in the *Depends fields and the hardcoded paths in SplittOff fields.

While using the precompiled binaries, you have to install the exact Pike version
used during package compilation.



*******************************************************************************
** Build from source:

  - download the latest info and patch files for Caudium from the Caudium FTP;
